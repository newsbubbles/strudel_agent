A warm, groovy house track with filtered bass and steady drums.

## Structure

### Intro (0-16 bars)

- Add [hats.js](../clips/hats.js) at bar 8 for groove

### Build (16-32 bars)

- Let the groove develop

### Main Section (32-64 bars)
- Full arrangement with all elements
- Experiment with filter sweeps on the bass

## Notes

This is a minimal house track structure. You can expand by:
- Adding chord progression clips

- Adding percussion variations
- Building breakdowns and drops
